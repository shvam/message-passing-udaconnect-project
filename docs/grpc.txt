Once the location-grpc service is running, Login to the corresponding pod with below command:

$ kubectl exec -it (location-grpc-pod)  --/bin/sh

Once inside the cotainer, run the client application which will send a grpc message to the kafka server

# python kafka-producer.py

Next run the kafka-consumer which will read the message and sends it to the grpc server

# python kafka-consumer.py
